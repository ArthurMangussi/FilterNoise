    ABSTRACT={In real-world scenarios, a huge variety of datasets contain inconsistencies. An example of such inconsistencies is missing data (MD), which is the lack of information in one or multiple variables. Missing imputation strategies emerged as a possible solution for addressing such a problem, which can replace the missing values based on mean, median, or Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The performance of such strategies depends on multiple factors. One factor that influences the missing value imputation (MVI) methods is the presence of noisy instances, described as anything that obscures the relationship between the features of an instance and its class, having an adversarial effect. However, the interaction between MD and noisy instances has received little attention in the literature. This work fills this gap by investigating missing and noisy data interplay. Our experimental setup begins with generating missingness under the Missing Not at Random (MNAR) mechanism in a multivariate scenario and performing imputation using seven state-of-the-art MVI methods. Subsequently, we apply our methodology to 11 real-world datasets. The effects of noise filtering before imputation are evaluated. The results show that noise preprocessing before the imputation task improves the imputation quality and the classification performance for imputed datasets.},
